# Overview

this program demonstrates basic caculator functionality of taking an array of inputs and performing caculations

this is a caculator program I made in an attempt to learn rust, is sucks, I could not figure out input, and the laungage's difficultys with conditionals, made the result much less then planned.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.  Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}
